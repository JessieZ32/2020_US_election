# 2020_US_election


In our paper, we use data from the websites of two institutions as follows,
- Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape;
- IPUMS USA.

First, Yijie Zhao used the link in part 1 of the pdf file given by Rohan Alexander to access the website of Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape. The url is https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/nationscape-data-set. On that web page, Yijie made a reques for full dataset of Nationscape survey data. Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape sent the unique link to Yijie's email address. And through that link, Yijie obtained the full dataset and our group choose a data file named ns20200625.dta, the most recent survey data.

Second, Yijie Zhao used the link in part 2 of the pdf file given by Rohan Alexander to access the website of IPUMS USA. The url is https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml. Yijie registered an account of this website. After email confirmation, Yijie selected some variables of our interest in ACS_2018 and extract a dta file of data we need for our analysis.

As the work of these two institutions doing survey and collecting data is very costly in time and energy, their work should be respected and their copyright should be protected. As these data are all private, we use gitignore to ignore the data file while pushing our project onto GitHub repository.
